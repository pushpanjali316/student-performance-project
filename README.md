# Student Performance Project 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **modular Python project** for analyzing student academic performance.  
It focuses on **structured data ingestion, cleaning, validation, feature engineering, and predictive analysis**, built with **scalability in mind** for future analytics and risk assessment.

---

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Modular Structure:** All core functionality organized under `src/` for maintainability.  
- **Data Loading:** Efficient CSV loading for raw student data (marks, attendance, assignments).  
- **Data Cleaning & Validation:** Ensures data integrity before analysis.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Prepares data for predictive modeling.  
- **ML Predictions:** Predicts dropout probability and risk levels.  
- **Visualization:** Generates charts for dropout probability and risk level distribution.  
- **Future-ready:** Placeholder modules for advanced risk scoring.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/pushpanjali316/student-performance-project.git


2. Navigate to the project folder
  cd student-performance-project

3. Install dependencies (if required)
  pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main program

5. python main.py

This will load, clean, validate, and analyze student data, producing charts for dropout probability and risk levels.
